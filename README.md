# GrinHighlighter

This VSCode extension provides syntax highlighting support for GRIN, a programming language made as a project
for ICS 33 at UC Irvine.

To install, first clone this repository with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhi-arya1/GrinHighlighter.git
```
And then install by going to VSCode Extensions, clicking `Install from VSIX`, and use `grin-0.0.1.vsix` from this repo.
Then, any files you make ending in `.grin` will be highlighted accordingly!

Full GRIN Syntax can be found [here](https://ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics33/ProjectGuide/Project3/)
